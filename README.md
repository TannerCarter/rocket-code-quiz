# Description

In this challenge I had to make a timed quiz that was a bit challenging and required a lot more JS than what I anticipated. In addition to this it really put my Google skills to work and take in as much information as possible and spend an ample amount of time to work out any bug fixes. Once I got the js down I had to work with my CSS to fit everything together.

# Tasks

- Create a coding quiz.
- When the start button is clicked.
- A new page presenting a question, and a timer starts.
- When a question is answered, it will take you to a new page with a question and where the timer left off on the last question.
- If a question is answered incorrectly, 20 seconds is deducted from the time left.
- When all three questions are answered, you are given a scored based on the time left on the clock;
- The score lets you save to the localstorage and is added onto the leaderboard of the omega quiz takers.
